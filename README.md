Why
===

When I read books or articles, I "love" some words and "hate" other ones, and I cannot explain why.
I used to jolt them down in my notepad and then compare my feelings about words with a friend of mine.
In the end, I think everyone "perceives" words differently and assign personal emotions to them.
I created 42words to know how my friends feel about some of these words, and which other words "affect" them the most.

How
===

Participating in this project is easy: whenever you read a book or article, and stumble upon a word that has some "pleasant" or "unpleasant" effect on you, add it to your list of "love", "hate" or "mixed feelings" words. This might happen once a week, once a month, or once a year, so don't feel in a rush!
Optionally, you can describe the emotion provoked by that word (are you disgusted? thrilled? surprised?) and the context in which you found it.
Finally, you can check how other people feel about that some word, and see the list of words collected by your friends.

OPTIONS
=======

* For each word, you can pick the language. Should default to your browser/country, or changeable in the settings
* Might tag them, or automatically call an API to find their definition and gender, ethimology, ancienty etc
* Might "queue" words to show your friends once a day
* (after you have entered a certain number of words, special stage?) You can also "challenge" friends: you describe a category (words for fruit, words with 3 Rs, etc) and a deadline (30 seconds, one day) and people submit a word and then you get to see them and you order them and who gets the best one wins. Also, external people can just play by voting (even by email, etc).

SCHEDULE
========

1a) an intro/about page with a form to log in/sign up // a page with your list of words and a form to enter a string and submit and go back there
1b) facilitate writing down words: with an SMS? An email? Taking a snapshot of the book page (a la Simple)? With a tweet? For now, email (it's free!), so a personal email for each account... should be the same email address that tells you You are welcome. For now just parse the word either in the subject or body. In the future also parse feelings and snapshots.
